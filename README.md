A service for authenticating the owner of a Bitcoin address

The purpose of this project is to create a method for an app or web service to verify that a person is in fact the owner of a particular Bitcoin address. In other words, to verify that they are in possession of the private key for a particular Bitcoin address without providing the private key.

Basic flow of this service is as follows:  
-Client requests a token from the service and supplies a Bitcoin public address that will be authenticated  
-Service responds with token  
-Client responds with token, and token ECDSA signature created by using their Bitcoin private key  
-Service responds with verification results (success or failure of challenge response for supplied Bitcoin address, token, and ECDSA signature)

The token is comprised of the following:  
1. The current time in seconds (to allow for token expiration)  
2. The supplied Bitcoin address from the client  
3. An ECDSA signature of (1) and (2) based on a private key generated by the service at launch and held in memory

This service is built on top of Flask-RESTful http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
