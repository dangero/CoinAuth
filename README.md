A service for authenticating the owner of a Bitcoin address

The purpose of this project is to create a method for an app or web service to verify that a person is in fact the owner of a particular Bitcoin address. In other words, to verify that they are in possession of the private key for a particular Bitcoin address without providing the private key.

Basic flow of this service is as follows:  
-Client requests a nonce from the service and supplies a Bitcoin public address that will be authenticated  
-Service responds with nonce  
-Client responds with nonce, and nonce ECDSA signature created by using their Bitcoin private key  
-Service responds with verification results (success or failure of challenge response for supplied Bitcoin address, nonce, and ECDSA signature)

The nonce is comprised of the following:  
1. A pseudo random number (for uniqueness) 
2. The current time in seconds (to allow for token expiration)  
3. The supplied Bitcoin address from the client  
4. An ECDSA signature of (1) and (2) based on a private key generated by the service at launch and held in memory

This service is built on top of Flask-RESTful http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
